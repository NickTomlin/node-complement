A stand-alone version of the common 'complement' or 'not' found in functional libraries

```javascript
var complement = require('./index');

function isDog (string) {
  return string === 'dog'
}

var isNotDog = complement(isDog);

assert(isDog('dog'));
assert(isNotDog('cat'));
assert(isNotDog('dog') === false);
```

FAQ

Q: Why even is this a module?

- I wanted to play around with tweaking my publishing process and this was a great excuse to publish something
- I wanted this without bringing in a library
- I hate `util.js` files littered with things that can be found elsewhere
